# Chapter 4: HTTPServer

Welcome back! In [Chapter 3: HTTPServerConfiguration & Listeners](03_httpserverconfiguration___listeners_.md), we learned how to create the blueprint (`HTTPServerConfiguration`) and define the front doors (`HTTPListenerConfiguration`) for our web server restaurant. We specified the address, port, security settings, and even designated our "chef" ([HTTPHandler](02_httphandler_.md)).

But a blueprint and a designated chef don't magically open a restaurant! We need someone to take that blueprint, actually build the restaurant at the specified address, open the doors, hire the staff, manage the day-to-day operations, and eventually close up shop. This is the role of the `HTTPServer`.

## The Restaurant Manager: What is `HTTPServer`?

Think of the `HTTPServer` as the **Restaurant Manager**. It's the main engine that brings everything together and makes the web server actually run.

Its key responsibilities are:

1.  **Setup:** Takes the `HTTPServerConfiguration` (the blueprint) you provide.
2.  **Build & Open:** Sets up the actual network listeners ("opens the doors") based on the `HTTPListenerConfiguration` definitions. This includes handling security (TLS/HTTPS) if configured.
3.  **Hire Staff:** Prepares the system to handle incoming requests, often by setting up worker threads (which we'll see in [HTTP Worker & Server Thread](05_http_worker___server_thread_.md)).
4.  **Oversee Operations:** Manages the lifecycle â€“ it starts the listening process and keeps it running.
5.  **Shutdown:** Provides a way to cleanly stop the server, closing the listeners and stopping the workers.

Without the `HTTPServer`, the configuration and handlers are just inactive code. The `HTTPServer` is the object that breathes life into them.

## Use Case: Starting Our "Hello World" Server

Let's revisit the configuration we built in Chapter 3. We had a `serverConfig` object that knew about our `HelloWorldHandler` and was told to listen on `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. How do we use `HTTPServer` to actually start this server?

1.  **Create the Manager:** Instantiate the `HTTPServer` class.
2.  **Give it the Blueprint:** Tell the `HTTPServer` to use our `serverConfig`.
3.  **Start the Server:** Call the `start()` method.
4.  **(Later) Stop the Server:** Call the `close()` method when we're done.

Here's how that looks in code:

```java
import io.fusionauth.http.server.HTTPServer;
import io.fusionauth.http.server.HTTPServerConfiguration;
import io.fusionauth.http.server.HTTPListenerConfiguration;
// Assume HelloWorldHandler is defined as in Chapter 2
// import com.example.HelloWorldHandler;
import java.net.InetAddress;

public class SimpleServer {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HTTPServer server = null;
        try {
            // --- Configuration from Chapter 3 ---
            HTTPServerConfiguration serverConfig = new HTTPServerConfiguration()
                .withHandler(new HelloWorldHandler()); // Our chef

            InetAddress localhost = InetAddress.getByName("127.0.0.1");
            HTTPListenerConfiguration listenerConfig = new HTTPListenerConfiguration(localhost, 8080); // Door: 127.0.0.1:8080

            serverConfig.withListener(listenerConfig); // Add door to blueprint
            // --- End Configuration ---

            // 1. Create the Server (Restaurant Manager)
            server = new HTTPServer();

            // 2. Give the Server its Configuration (Blueprint)
            server.withConfiguration(serverConfig);

            // 3. Start the Server (Open the restaurant!)
            System.out.println("Starting server on http://127.0.0.1:8080...");
            server.start();
            System.out.println("Server started!");

            // Keep the main thread alive (otherwise the program would exit immediately)
            // In a real application, this might wait for a shutdown signal.
            System.out.println("Press Enter to stop the server...");
            System.in.read();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Server error: " + e.getMessage());
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            // 4. Stop the Server (Close the restaurant)
            if (server != null) {
                System.out.println("Stopping server...");
                server.close();
                System.out.println("Server stopped.");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Let's break down the key `HTTPServer` parts:

1.  `server = new HTTPServer();`: We create an instance of the `HTTPServer`. It's now ready to be configured.
2.  `server.withConfiguration(serverConfig);`: We pass the `HTTPServerConfiguration` object (which contains our handler and listener info) to the server. Now the manager has the blueprints.
3.  `server.start();`: This is the magic button! The `HTTPServer` reads the configuration, sets up the listener on port 8080, prepares the internal machinery, and starts accepting connections. Your program will *not* block here; the server runs in the background (on other threads). That's why we need the `System.in.read()` to keep the main program alive.
4.  `server.close();`: When we want to stop (e.g., after pressing Enter), we call `close()`. This tells the server to stop accepting new connections, wait for ongoing requests to finish (up to a configured timeout), and clean up resources. Using a `finally` block ensures `close()` is called even if errors occur.

If you ran this code, you could open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`, and you would see "Hello, World!" served by your `HelloWorldHandler`.

## Under the Hood: What Happens During `start()` and `close()`?

You don't *need* to know the internal details to use the server, but understanding the basics helps.

**When `start()` is called:**

1.  **Read Config:** The `HTTPServer` looks at the `HTTPServerConfiguration` it was given.
2.  **Initialize Context:** It creates an `HTTPContext` (a place to potentially share information across requests, though not used in our simple example).
3.  **Loop Through Listeners:** It gets the list of `HTTPListenerConfiguration` objects from the main configuration.
4.  **Create Server Threads:** For *each* listener configuration, it creates an internal helper object, often a dedicated thread (like `HTTPServerThread` in this project). This thread is responsible *only* for that specific listener (e.g., port 8080).
5.  **Open Socket:** The `HTTPServerThread` opens a network socket on the specified bind address and port (e.g., `127.0.0.1:8080`). It configures TLS/HTTPS if required by the listener config.
6.  **Start Listening Thread:** The `HTTPServerThread` is started. It begins actively listening for incoming client connections on its socket.
7.  **Return:** The `start()` method returns control to your code almost immediately. The actual listening happens on the background threads.

Here's a simplified view of the startup sequence:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant YourApp as Your Application
    participant Server as HTTPServer
    participant Config as HTTPServerConfiguration
    participant Listener as HTTPListenerConfiguration
    participant ServerThread as HTTPServerThread (Internal)
    participant Network as OS Network Layer

    YourApp->>+Server: new HTTPServer()
    YourApp->>+Server: withConfiguration(config)
    YourApp->>+Server: start()
    Server->>Config: getListeners()
    Config-->>Server: Returns list [Listener]
    loop For each Listener in list
        Server->>+ServerThread: new HTTPServerThread(Config, Listener)
        ServerThread->>Network: Open Socket (Listener.bindAddress, Listener.port)
        Note right of ServerThread: Configures TLS if needed
        Network-->>ServerThread: Socket ready
        Server->>ServerThread: start()  # Starts the thread
        ServerThread-->>-Server: Thread started
    end
    Server-->>-YourApp: start() returns (Server is running)
```

**When `close()` is called:**

1.  **Signal Shutdown:** The `HTTPServer` tells each of its internal `HTTPServerThread` objects to shut down gracefully.
2.  **Stop Accepting:** Each `HTTPServerThread` stops accepting *new* incoming connections on its socket.
3.  **Wait for Workers:** The server might wait for currently active worker threads (handling ongoing requests) to complete, up to a specified `shutdownDuration` from the configuration. (More on workers in the [next chapter](05_http_worker___server_thread_.md)).
4.  **Close Sockets:** The network sockets are closed.
5.  **Stop Threads:** The internal server threads (`HTTPServerThread`) stop executing.
6.  **Cleanup:** Resources are released.

## Diving Deeper: Code Snippets (Simplified)

Let's peek inside `main/java/io/fusionauth/http/server/HTTPServer.java` (simplified for clarity).

**Inside `start()`:**

```java
// Simplified from main/java/io/fusionauth/http/server/HTTPServer.java

public HTTPServer start() {
    // ... (logging, context setup omitted) ...

    try {
        // Get the list of listeners from the configuration
        for (HTTPListenerConfiguration listener : configuration.getListeners()) {
            // Create a dedicated thread for this listener
            HTTPServerThread serverThread = new HTTPServerThread(configuration, listener);
            servers.add(serverThread); // Keep track of the thread

            // Start the background thread. This thread will open the socket
            // and start listening for connections.
            serverThread.start();
            logger.info("HTTP server listening on port [{}]", listener.getPort());
        }
        logger.info("HTTP server started successfully");
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // ... (error handling and cleanup omitted) ...
    }

    return this; // Return immediately, server runs in background
}
```
This shows the loop creating and starting an `HTTPServerThread` for each listener defined in the configuration. The actual socket opening happens *inside* the `HTTPServerThread`.

**Inside `close()`:**

```java
// Simplified from main/java/io/fusionauth/http/server/HTTPServer.java

@Override
public void close() {
    logger.info("HTTP server shutdown requested.");
    long shutdownMillis = configuration.getShutdownDuration().toMillis();

    // 1. Tell all server threads to begin shutting down
    for (HTTPServerThread thread : servers) {
        thread.shutdown(); // Signal the thread to stop
    }

    // 2. Wait for each thread to finish (up to the timeout)
    for (Thread thread : servers) {
        try {
            thread.join(shutdownMillis); // Wait for thread completion
        } catch (InterruptedException e) { /* Ignore */ }
        // ... (check elapsed time omitted) ...
    }

    logger.info("HTTP server shutdown successfully.");
}
```
This demonstrates the two-phase shutdown: first, signal all threads (`thread.shutdown()`), then wait for them to finish (`thread.join()`).

## Conclusion

You've now met the `HTTPServer` - the main engine or "Restaurant Manager" of our web server. It's the component that takes the `HTTPServerConfiguration` blueprint and makes the server operational.

You learned:

*   The `HTTPServer` orchestrates the entire server lifecycle.
*   You configure it using `withConfiguration()`, passing the setup defined in [Chapter 3: HTTPServerConfiguration & Listeners](03_httpserverconfiguration___listeners_.md).
*   `start()` brings the server online, opening listeners and preparing to handle requests using background threads.
*   `close()` performs a graceful shutdown, closing listeners and stopping threads.

The `HTTPServer` sets up the stage, but who actually handles each customer (client request) that walks through the door? The manager (`HTTPServer`) delegates this to dedicated staff.

Let's move on to the next chapter to meet the workforce: [HTTP Worker & Server Thread](05_http_worker___server_thread_.md), and see how individual connections and requests are handled.
